# JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML elements with JavaScript code. An HTML element has an opening and closing tags, content, and attribute in the opening tag. However, some HTML elements may not have content and a closing tag - they are self closing elements. To create HTML elements in React we do not use the _createElement()_ instead we just use JSX elements. Therefore, JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML elements in React. JSX will be converted to JavaScript on browser using a transpiler - [babel.js](https://babeljs.io/). Babel is a library which transpiles JSX to pure JavaScript and latest JavaScript to older version. See the JSX code below.

```js
// JSX syntax
// we don't need to use quotes with JSX

const jsxElement = <h1>I am a JSX element</h1>
const welcome = <h1>Welcome to  React Workshop</h1>
const data = <small>By Skill Safari</small>
```

The above strange looking code seems like JavaScript and it seems like , but it is not JavaScript and it seems like HTML but not completely an HTML element. It is a mix of JavaScript and an HTML elements. JSX can allow us to use HTML in JavaScript. The HTML element in the JSX above is _h1_ and _small_.

#### JSX Element

As you have seen in the example above, JSX has a JavaScript and HTML like syntax. JSX element could be a single HTML element or many HTML elements wrapped in a parent HTML element.

This JSX element has only one HTML element which is _h1_.

```js
const jsxElement = <h1>I am a JSX element</h1> // JS with HTML
```

Let's make more JSX elements by declaring a new variable named title and content inside _h2_.

```js
const title = <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
```

Let us add a subtitles and other contents to this JSX element by adding additional HTML elements. Every HTML element should be wrapped by an outer HTML element to create a valid JSX element. The name title variable also should be changed to header because our JSX element is containing almost all of the header of the application.

```js
const header = (
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to React Workshop</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
    <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
  </header>
)
```

Let us keep adding more elements. Additional HTML elements to display the author name and year.

```js
const header = (
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome React Workshop</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
    <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
    <p>Asabeneh Yetayeh</p>
    <small>By Skill Safari</small>
  </header>
)
```

As you can see the _header_ element is a parent element for all the inner HTML elements and JSX must be wrapped by an outer parent element. Without the _header_ HTML element or other parent HTML element the above JSX is invalid.

#### Commenting a JSX element

We comment codes for different reasons and it is also good to know how to comment out JSX elements in React.

```js
{
  /*
 <header>
     <h1>Welcome React Workshop</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
    <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
    <p>Asabeneh Yetayeh</p>
    <small>By Skill Safari</small>
  </header>

*/
}
```

#### Rendering a JSX Element

To render a JSX element to HTML document, we should first create an index HTML. The index.html is the only HTML file you will have in any React Application. That is why we say that every React Application is a single page application. Let us create an index.html file. We can get started with React in two ways - either by using CDN or create-react-app. The create-react-app creates a React project boilerplate outbox and because of that, many people do have a hard time to understand how React works. In order to make things clear for absolute beginners I would like to start with a CDN. We use CDN only in this section and we will use the create-reap-app in the rest of the challenge and I also recommend you to use only create-react-app all the time.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>React Workshop</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="root"></div>

    <script></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

As you can see from the above index.html, we have one div with a class root and script. The root _div_ is the gateway to connect all react components to the index.html. In the script tag we will write our JavaScript, but the script _type_ will be _babel_. Babel will _transpile_ the react JSX to pure JavaScript on the browser. Let us add babel to the script. Inside the babel, we can write any pure JavaScript, JSX and in general any React code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>React Workshop</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="root"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      // our code goes here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The babel library is linked to our document and now we can make use of it. The next step is importing _React_ and _ReactDOM_ using CDN or link. In order to link React and ReactDOM, we attach both packages from CDN to the body of index.html. To test if React is linked to the index.html, try to check it by doing console.log(React). Open the browser console and you should get an object. If you see an object containing React methods then you managed to link your project with React CDN and you are ready to use React.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>React Workshop</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="root"></div>

    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      console.log(React)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now the index.html has everything we need to write React code. Let us get the root element using document.querySelect('.root') and assign it to a variable name rootElement. The is the only place we directly interact with DOM.

Now, you knew JSX and JSX element. Let us render the JSX element on the browser, in order to do so we need the React and ReactDOM library. In addition to the React and ReactDOM we need babel to transpile the JSX to JavaScript code. The ReactDOM package has a method render. The render method takes two arguments:a JSX element or a component and the root document.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>React Workshop</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="root"></div>

    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      // To get the root element from the HTML document
      const rootElement = document.querySelector('.root')

      // JSX element
      const jsxElement = <h1>I am a JSX element</h1>

      // we render the JSX element using the ReactDOM package
      // ReactDOM has the render method and the render method takes two arguments
      ReactDOM.render(jsxElement, rootElement)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```


Let us render more content. To render more content, the JSX element should have more HTML elements. For instance, we can create a header of a website and header may have a title, subtitle, author or date etc. Remember, we can render only one JSX element at a time.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>React Workshop</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="root"></div>

    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      // To get the root element from the HTML document
      const rootElement = document.querySelector('.root')

      // JSX element
      const header = (
        <header>
          <h1>Welcome React Workshop</h1>
          <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
          <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
          <p>Asabeneh Yetayeh</p>
          <small>By Skill Safari</small>
        </header>
      )

      // we render the JSX element using the ReactDOM package
      // ReactDOM has the render method and the render method takes two arguments
      ReactDOM.render(header, rootElement)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```



We have created a JSX element for the header of the website. How about the main and the footer for the website? Similar to the header, let us create a JSX element for the main and the footer.

JSX element for the main part of the website.

```js
// JSX element
const main = (
  <main>
    <p>Prerequisite to get started react.js:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
  </main>
)
```

JSX element for the footer part of the website.

```js
// JSX element
const footer = (
  <footer>
    <p>Copyright 2021</p>
  </footer>
)
```

Now, we have three JSX elements: the header, main and footer. The best way to render all of the three JSX elements is by wrapping them all in a parent JSX element or putting them in an array. To include JSX element inside another JSX element we use the curly bracket, {} and call the name of the JSX inside the curly bracket.

```js
// JSX element for the header part of the website
const header = (
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome React Workshop</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
    <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
    <p>Asabeneh Yetayeh</p>
    <small>By Skill Safari</small>
  </header>
)

// JSX element for the main part of the website
const main = (
  <main>
    <p>Prerequisite to get started react.js:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
  </main>
)

// JSX element for the footer part of the website
const footer = (
  <footer>
    <p>Copyright 2020</p>
  </footer>
)

// JSX element which contain all, it is a container or parent
const app = (
  <div>
    {header}
    {main}
    {footer}
  </div>
)
```
Now, let us put everything together and render it to the browser.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>30 Days Of React Challenge</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="root"></div>

    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      // To get the root element from the HTML document
      const rootElement = document.querySelector('.root')

      // JSX element, header
      const header = (
        <header>
          <h1>Welcome to 30 Days Of React</h1>
          <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
          <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
          <p>Asabeneh Yetayeh</p>
          <small>Oct 2, 2020</small>
        </header>
      )

      // JSX element, main
      const main = (
        <main>
          <p>Prerequisite to get started react.js:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
          </ul>
        </main>
      )

      // JSX element, footer
      const footer = (
        <footer>
          <p>Copyright 2020</p>
        </footer>
      )

      // JSX element, app, a container or a parent
      const app = (
        <div>
          {header}
          {main}
          {footer}
        </div>
      )

      // we render the JSX element using the ReactDOM package
      // ReactDOM has the render method and the render method takes two argument
      ReactDOM.render(app, rootElement)
      // or
      //  ReactDOM.render([header, main, footer], rootElement)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
